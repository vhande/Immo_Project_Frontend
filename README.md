# About The Project


It's a full stack recreation of a real estate website. You can test it by clicking [here](https://immo-endproject.netlify.app)<br>	


**Important Note: As I use the free plan of Render, it takes the server 30 seconds to spin up again after a period of inactivity. You'll be able to see the ads that I added to the database in 30 seconds after you click on the link. Thank you for your patience!**<br>	## About the project
